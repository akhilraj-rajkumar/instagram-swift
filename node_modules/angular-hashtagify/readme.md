# angular-hashtagify

Angular directive that enables hashtag support for your app.  [See it in action on Plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/TgZqXG?p=info).

## Install

```
npm install angular-hashtagify
```

## Usage

Inject the **hashtagify** module into your application.

```javascript
angular.module('YourApp', ['hashtagify']);
```

**HTML** -

```html
<div ng-bind-html="trustHtml(tag.text)"
     hashtagify 
     term-click="tagTermClick($event)" 
     user-click="tagUserClick($event)">
</div>
```

**JavaScript** -

```javascript
angular.module('YourApp.controllers')

.controller('MainCtrl', ['$scope', '$sce',
    function($scope, $sce) {
        $scope.tag = {
            text: 'Hey @Joe where you goin\' with that #gun in your hand?'
        };
            
        $scope.tagUserClick = function(e) {
            var tagText = e.target.innerText;
            // tagText is '@Joe'. You could use this to verify
            // that your app has a 'Joe' user and then redirect
            // to a view that displays this user profile.
        };
        
        $scope.tagTermClick = function(e) {
            var tagText = e.target.innerText;
            // tagText is '#gun'. You could use this to display
            // all posts/info that has a hashtag with this value.
        };
        
        // You could define 'tagUserClick' and 'tagTermClick'
        // on the '$rootScope'. This way you can handle whatever
        // logic you want for hashtags in one place rather than
        // having to define it in each controller.
        
        $scope.trustHtml = function(html) {
            // Sanitize manually if necessary. It's likely this
            // html has already been sanitized server side
            // before it went into your database.
            // Don't hold me liable for XSS... never assume :~)
            return $sce.trustAsHtml(html);
        };
    }
]);
```
